## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# README
## My name is Caleb!
### I am pursuing a degree in computer science to hopefully enter the field of game/website development. I am on the bowling team here at Judson but also play golf! I am originally from Pittsburgh, Pa and moved to Huntley, Il before highschool. I love cars and drive a Toyota Gt86, it is awesome in the summer but staying on the road when its snowing is a 50/50 shot.
